# Ralph Wiggum Loop: firebase.do TDD Implementation

## Task
Implement the firebase.do project - a 100% Firebase API-compatible backend using mongo.do.

## Instructions

1. Run `bd ready` to see available work
2. Pick up to 5 [RED] test issues that are ready
3. Launch parallel subagents to implement each issue
4. When subagents complete, close the issues with `bd close`
5. Check `bd stats` - when all issues are closed, output the completion promise

## Completion Criteria
- All 109 beads issues are closed
- Tests pass for all modules

## Completion Promise
When ALL issues are complete, output:
```
<promise>FIREBASE.DO COMPLETE</promise>
```
